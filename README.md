# dax-stax-cli

## This is a cli tool that scaffolds my favorite tech stack in seconds without any boilerplate

</br>
</br>

### - The stack is made of:

-    NextJs
-    Typescript
-    TailwindCSS

</br>

#### - Extra Deps:

-    ESLint
-    Prettier
-    prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
-    SASS

#### - Note:

</br>

This stack uses NextJs 13 app directory (beta) as a replacement for the old
pages directory.

This cli tool is by no means perfect. Its a project i worked on that helps me
scaffold NextJs projects as fast as possible.
